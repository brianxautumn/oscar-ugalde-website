<div id="about_me">
<p>
As part of my professional development I came to San Francisco to take at SFSU, The Multimedia Studies Program, <br>
Professional Certificate, Concentration in Print, UX/UI Design and Web Development.  This is in order to <br>
continue to growing up in knowledge and skills according with my professional background. 
</p>

<p>
And now it is my intention to be part of a creative team in the Bay Area as an Art Director, Graphic or  <br>
Visual Designer, (UX/UI).
</p>
<p>
I am a familiar with working with the needs of account executives that are looking to resolve <br> aesthetic 
problems and can do so with ease. My expertise is a variety of understanding <br>what clients want 
and how to achieve it – on time, and under budget. 
</p>
<p>
Working with advertising and design is what motivates me. I’ve had the privilege to work <br>
all over Central America, including: Guandu Publicidad, BBDO and JWT.
